## Design Process
### User Stories
As someone who works and studies in a society which idolizes achievements more than anything, we are prone to burnout. We wanted to make a website that can benefit society and be able to address such problems.

Apart from resources like articles and YouTube videos, the website uses a gamification concept to make it more interactive to the point it encourages users to keep coming back to our website. As people idolize their achievements, we came up with a point system for our website.

This points can then be used to unlock a feature, such as dark mode. Dark mode improves the user's experience of the website in low-light environments. Similar to gaming, there is also a leaderboard system where users can compete with their friends for rankings and to get noticed. We believe such features should encourage them to continuously use our website.

In our research, we have seen quite a lot of gamification concept for study and E-commerce apps, but not for a well-being app. Thus, this idea is as original and authentic as we made it to be.

Although this might not fully address the problem, we hope our website can at least put a smile on our users’ face.
### Layout
As the layout of our website uses a common structure, it should avoid any confusion when users navigate our website. This is achieved by ensuring all pages uses centralised content, titles are of same font and size, and that subheaders are in italics. Despite being limited to a common structure, we have made it in a way that it is still interesting enough to look at, especially with varieties of content placement per section.
### Pictures
The website’s background images consist mostly of mountain images, as we wanted to emphasise the idea of tranquillity and peace.
### Colour Schemes
The goal of our web app is to let people take a break and reconnect with their emotions. Hence, the main colour scheme of this website is green #20302B and blue #7A949C, both colours of nature, representing harmony and calm.

Using the same colour scheme for all the pages ensures consistency, but it can get too repetitive and boring. Thus, we also use bright colours such as yellow #ffff00 to highlight important words, saturated and intense blue #1b0d9e as background colours of some containers.

Our website’s text colours are pretty standard, consisting of either black, white or grey. Doing so should help people to focus better on the information content and not get distracted.

As for dark mode, we avoid using pure black as much as possible as it can cause eye strain for the user. Hence, we use dark blue #040822 and dark green #001116 as our main dark mode colours.
### Typography 
This website uses font pairing of yeseva one for headers and default bootstrap font-family of Helvetica Neue for the rest. Yeseva one font has a good mix of bold corners and curves to make it friendly yet formal enough for this website.

Most importantly, it gives a vibe of The Buddha which relates to meditation and our website in general. This font is unique and hence, becomes the "signature piece" of our website as it is also featured in our logo.

Bootstrap's default font is flexible and versatile enough to work with yeseva one. It's clean and a familiar font to everyone, so it's gives a sense of comfort.
### Logo
Our idea of the logo sparked after we finalised the typography. Hence, we decided to make a mix of typography-based and lettermark logo. Pronounced as Tran-quil, we decided that our logo should include the letter ‘T’ and ‘Q’. TQ is also a short form of "thank you" which represents gratefulness, also something that we try to encourage in our website. 

As we used quite a few mountain images, including a mountain graphics stacked behind the letters just makes sense as it gives a sense of completeness to the logo. The colour chosen is not far from our main colour scheme. We have 2 logo colours for light and dark mode so it's visible for both modes.

The positioning of the letter ‘T’ is higher than the letter ‘Q’ gives a sense of safety, similar to an umbrella on a rainy day. We hope doing so would encourage the user to trust our website.
### Others
* Scrollbar: We modified the scrollbar to make it look more friendly and less "boxy" and old-fashioned.
* Border radius: Some pictures, buttons and containers have borders to make it look less intimidating.
* Shadows: Some containers use shadow to make it stand out and less flat. 
* Emojis: Some emojis are used to make it less tense and a bit more playful.
* Huge font-size for homepage's header: Following modern User Interface (UI) trends, it draws user attention to the text and not intimidate them with too much information.
* Hover effects: Distinguishing between clickable elements is important for a good user experience. Hence we made sure we had different styles and effects showing for most buttons and links.
