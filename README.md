## Design Process
### User Stories
### Colour Schemes
The goal of our web app is to let people take a break and reconnect with their emotions. Hence, the main color scheme of this website is green #20302B and blue #7A949C - both the color of nature, harmony and calm. Using the same color scheme for all the pages ensures consistency but it can get too repetitive and boring. That is why we introduce bright colors like yellow #ffff00 to highlight important words ,and saturated, intense blue #1b0d9e as background colors of some containers. 

We keep text colors pretty standard of either only black, white or grey. This way, people will focus on the content of the information and not get distracted. 

As for dark mode, we avoid using pure black as much as possible as it can cause eye strain for user. Hence, we use dark blue #040822 and dark green #001116 as our main dark mode colors. 
### Typography 
This website uses font pairing of yeseva one for headers and default bootstrap font-family of Helvetica Neue for the rest. Yeseva one font has a good mix of bold corners and curves to make it friendly yet formal enough for this website. Most importantly, it gives a vibe of The Buddha which relates to meditation and our website in general. This font is unique and hence, become the "Signature piece" of our website as it's also featured in our logo. Bootstrap's default font is flexible and versatile enough to work with yeseva one. It's clean and a familiar font to everyone, so it's gives a sense of comfort.
### Logo
Our idea of the logo sparked after we finalised the typography. Hence, we decided to make a mix of typography-based and lettermark logo. Pronounced as Tran-quil, we decided that our logo should include letter "T" and "Q". TQ is also a short form of "thank you" which represents gratefullness- something we try to encourage in our website. 

We used many mountain images and hence including a mountain graphics stacked behind the letters just makes sense and gives sense of completeness to the logo. Color chosen are not far from our main color scheme. We have 2 logo colors for light and dark mode so it's visible for both modes.

The way letter T is higher than letter Q gives a sense of safety - like an umbrella on a rainy day. This encourages the user to trust our website.
### Layout
### Others
* Scrollbar : We modify the scrollbar to make it look more friendly and less "boxy" and old-fashioned.
* Border radius : Some pictures, buttons and containers have borders to make it look less intimidating.
* Shadows: Some containers use shadow to make it stand out and less flat. 
* Emojis: Some emojis are used to make it less tense and a bit more playful.
* Huge font-size for homepage's header: following modern UI trends, it draws user attention to the text and not intimidate them with too much information.
* Hover effects: distiguishing between elements that are clickable is important for a good user experience. Hence we made sure we had different styles/effects showing for most buttons/ links
